# Stable Diffusion Image Generation in Google Colab

This notebook demonstrates how to generate images using the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model directly within Google Colab.

## How it works

1.  **Installation**: Installs necessary libraries (`diffusers`, `transformers`, `accelerate`, `torch`).
2.  **Model Loading**: Loads the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model onto the GPU for efficient image generation.
3.  **Image Generation**: Uses a user-defined text prompt to generate an image and saves it as `ai_lab_result.png`.
4.  **`.gitignore`**: Creates a `.gitignore` file to help keep your repository clean of generated artifacts and large model files.

## Getting Started

### Running in Google Colab

1.  Open this notebook in Google Colab.
2.  Ensure you have a GPU runtime selected (Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU).
3.  Run all cells sequentially (Runtime > Run all).
4.  After execution, the generated image will be saved as `ai_lab_result.png` in your Colab environment. You can view it by clicking the 'Files' icon on the left panel.

### Customization

*   **Prompt**: Modify the `prompt` variable in the image generation cell to describe what you want the AI to create.
*   **Negative Prompt**: Adjust the `n_prompt` variable to specify elements you want to avoid in the generated image.
*   **Guidance Scale**: Experiment with `guidance_scale` for more or less adherence to your prompt.

## Example Output

Below is the image generated by the notebook with the default prompt:

![Generated Image](ai_lab_result.png)
